        <h2>145.210 </h2>
The Daisy 145.210 repeater is located on Bald Mountain in southern Pittsburg county. 
 "210" is built from a 110W continuous duty GE Mastr III repeater station.  
 Control, IDs, courtesy tones, etc. are provided by the Audio Test Solutions RLC Club Deluxe controller, which also provides control for the 442.400 repeater. 
 Automated weather alerts are provided by the CAT WX-250 SAME weather alert receiver.  
 Even though 210 and 400 share the same controller, both repeaters can be separated with independent IDs, timers, etc., with the WX-250 being the only thing in common.
