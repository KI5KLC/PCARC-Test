          The new 443.725 antenna has arrived! We're getting  <br>
          closer folks. Remember, 725 will have linking       <br>
          capabilities to <a href="https://swira.link/" target="_blank">SWIRA</a> via the Davis repeater.<br>

          Two more amplifiers built tonight. These are needed <br>
          because the receiver discriminator audio from the   <br>
          Kenwood radios we are using is a bit too low to set <br>
          the input reference levels on the repeater          <br>
          controllers correctly. These give them a boost so   <br>
          that everything can be set correctly and balanced.  <br>

          One of the link radio audio amps for Stuart is built<br>
          (repeater RX audio amp will be very similar). I did <br>
          a slight redesign on the board layout, which I will <br>
          incorporate into future builds. This one has pass   <br>
          throughs for PL Detect, COR, PTT and TX Audio.      <br>

          Work continues on the new repeaters for Stuart. The <br>
          cabinet is out of the paint booth and the equipment <br>
          has been installed. Still quite a bit of work to    <br>
          do but it's coming along nicely.                    <br>

          Kenwood TK-790's converted to N connectors, because <br>

          ICS Linker II repeater controller under the knife. This     <br>
          controller will be used on the new 146.895 repeater. I'll   <br>
          be swapping these no name DB9 male connectors for TE        <br>
          Connectivity DB9 females. This is done in order to keep all <br>
          our controllers modular, or plug & play with our various    <br>
          setups. We don't use gender changers or adapters as they're <br>
          a potential failure point. Do it right the first time & be  <br>
          done with it. I'll be using my Hakko 808 desoldering gun    <br>
          and my Hakko 936 station for the hot work. The iron is a    <br>

          Prepping a couple of Kenwood TK-790 mobiles for repeater      <br>
          service. These are going to Stuart on the 895 pair. First     <br>
          thing is to override the ignition sense. Simple: R506 out,    <br>
          R504 in. 0 ohm resistor (aka jumper/solder blob). Toothbrush  <br>
          for scale. Next is bridge "SB" and replace F501, a .5 amp     <br>
          DB25 accessory port fuse with a 1 amp fuse. This will put B+  <br>
          voltage to the DB 25 accessory port & power the KM5UQ audio   <br>
          amplifier needed to bring the audio level up. We've found out <br>
          through testing they draw about .75 amps and the original     <br>
          fuse just won't handle it. No problem. The board is more than <br>
          capable of supplying the needed amperage. Kenwood was very    <br>
          conservative with the .5 amp fuse. RF power on the TX radio   <br>
          will be set to 35 watts on this particular TX radio. They are <br>
          quite robust with proper cooling. As KD5JCX says: things are  <br>
          happening. I'll be posting more progress on the new Stuart    <br>
          equipment soon. I'm on it!
