                The new 443.725 antenna has arrived! We're getting  <br>
                closer folks. Remember, 725 will have linking       <br>
                capabilities to <a href="https://swira.link/" target="_blank">SWIRA</a> via the Davis repeater.<br>

                Two more amplifiers built tonight. These are needed <br>
                because the receiver discriminator audio from the   <br>
                Kenwood radios we are using is a bit too low to set <br>
                the input reference levels on the repeater          <br>
                controllers correctly. These give them a boost so   <br>
                that everything can be set correctly and balanced.  <br>

                One of the link radio audio amps for Stuart is built<br>
                (repeater RX audio amp will be very similar). I did <br>
                a slight redesign on the board layout, which I will <br>
                incorporate into future builds. This one has pass   <br>
                throughs for PL Detect, COR, PTT and TX Audio.      <br>

                Work continues on the new repeaters for Stuart. The <br>
                cabinet is out of the paint booth and the equipment <br>
                has been installed. Still quite a bit of work to    <br>
                do but it's coming along nicely.                    <br>

                Prepping a couple of Kenwood TK-790 mobiles for repeater      <br>
                service. These are going to Stuart on the 895 pair. First     <br>
                thing is to override the ignition sense. Simple: R506 out,    <br>
                R504 in. 0 ohm resistor (aka jumper/solder blob). Toothbrush  <br>
                for scale. Next is bridge "SB" and replace F501, a .5 amp     <br>
                DB25 accessory port fuse with a 1 amp fuse. This will put B+  <br>
                voltage to the DB 25 accessory port & power the KM5UQ audio   <br>
                amplifier needed to bring the audio level up. We've found out <br>
                through testing they draw about .75 amps and the original     <br>
                fuse just won't handle it. No problem. The board is more than <br>
                capable of supplying the needed amperage. Kenwood was very    <br>
                conservative with the .5 amp fuse. RF power on the TX radio   <br>
                will be set to 35 watts on this particular TX radio. They are <br>
                quite robust with proper cooling. As KD5JCX says: things are  <br>
                happening. I'll be posting more progress on the new Stuart    <br>
                equipment soon. I'm on it!
